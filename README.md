# Autonomous-Robot-SLRC-2025
🚀 SLRC 2025 – Team Nucleo 5 | Autonomous Robot Showcase 
Proud to share our robot built for the Sri Lanka Robotics Challenge 2025!
We designed and built a fully autonomous robot capable of completing 6 advanced tasks:

🔸 Grid navigation & color based ball pickup
🔸 Wall following & ramp climbing
🔸 Barcode reading & ball sorting
🔸 Red box localization in a 9x9 grid & placement
🔸 Final planting task based on environmental input

🎯 The entire robot was programmed for full autonomy, with no manual intervention.

🛠️ Key components:

• STM32F401 MCU
• Encoded DC motors + BTS7960 drivers
• TCS3472 color sensors
• PCA9685 servo driver + 6 servo motors
• IR sensors (line detection)
• Ultrasonic sensors (distance measurements)

This project challenged and strengthened our skills in embedded systems, sensor integration, and autonomous decision making.
